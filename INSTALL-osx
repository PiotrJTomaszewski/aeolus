AEOLUS 0.8.4  BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (OSX)
______________________________________

December 2014

As of version 0.8.2 Aeolus now works on OS X.

Aeolus uses JACK[1]. If you are not familiar with JACK you will want to read
up a little because Aeolus won't make any sound until you connect it to the
system output port.

Aeolus registers itself as a CoreMIDI virtual destination. This means programs
like MidiKeys[2] will allow you to select Aeolus as a destination. A USB MIDI
driver will probably not automatically select Aeolus as a destination and
provide you no means for doing so yourself. For this you need to either use
MidiKeys with MIDI thru, or a patch bay such as MIDI Patchbay[3]. In my
experience MidiKeys is easier and more reliable, at least in the face of my
apparently-buggy USB MIDI driver (in 2008, anyway).

Building Aeolus
---------------
Assuming you have all the dependencies worked out, you just need to
make and make install using the proper makefile.

    make -f Makefile-osx
    make -f Makefile-osx install

Building clthreads and clxclient works the same way. (clalsadrv is not needed for OSX)

If you get dlopen errors like this:

    Error: can't open user interface plugin: dlopen(/usr/local/lib64/aeolus_x11.so, 2): Library not loaded: libclxclient.3.6.1.dylib
      Referenced from: /usr/local/lib64/aeolus_x11.so
      Reason: image not found.

Then do this:

    ln -sf /usr/local/lib64/libcl* /usr/local/lib

Running Aeolus
--------------

Jack needs to be running, so fire up JackPilot and start Jack, or on the
command line run
    
    jack -d coreaudio

Then start Aeolus. The usual requirements apply (stops directory, etc.)

    aeolus

Connect aeolus to the system audio output in your Jack patchbay.
Finally, connect your MIDI source to Aeolus, e.g. using MidiKeys.
Select some stops, and Aeolus should sound.
